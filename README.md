# DataProductsProject
In this repository I have uploaded the ui.R and server.R files for the shiny app that I built. 

The easiest way to check the app is by downloading both files (in the same directory), opening them both and then running the runApp function in the terminal (which is available in the shiny package). You do not require any other package other than shiny

If you have trouble opening the app, I have also uploaded it to shinyapps. You can find it in the following [link](https://octavio-reyes-matte.shinyapps.io/DataProducts_project/) 

I have also built a presentation with more background information about the topic of the app, which can be found [here](https://octavio-reyes-matte.shinyapps.io/beta_dist_simulation/#1)
